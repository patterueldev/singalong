# Overview
A simple karaoke application to play songs and reserve songs.

## Initial Stories
- A player that plays a list of reserved songs
- Player should show the list of reserved songs
- Player should *delete* the reservation after playing
- Controller should see the list of reserved songs
- Controller should be able to view a list of songs
- Controller should be able to select from the list of available songs
- Controller should be able reserve a song
- Controller may also stop or skip a reserved song, but make sure to prompt the user
- Maybe some identifier for Controllers would be good just to secure reserved songs
